# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Playable in the console, it supports two players who take turns marking a 3Ã—3 grid with 'X' and 'O'. The first to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
